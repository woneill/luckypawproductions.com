Over my 25+ year career I have had the honor of telling some incredible stories. I have begun to showcase some of them here.

I LOVE my job and I LOVE being given the opportunity to tell interesting stories. I am always looking for interesting stories to tell! If you know of anyone needing a Video Storyteller, I would love to talk with them.

As for my company's story... Lucky Paw Productions was named after my childhood dog, Kristie. I swear she had a "lucky paw". I am a BIG Buffalo Bills fan and every time I would hold her right paw when the Bills were in the red zone, they would score a TD! Why do you think we went to four Superbowls? It was the LUCKY PAW!
